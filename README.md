TEO Language Parser
===================

The language parser of TEO 0.4.

## Design Concepts

TEO is a brilliant way to develop backend server. The previous version of TEO
language parser is not good enough. It is responding slowly. So I decide to 
update the syntax and rewrite the parser.

## Targeted Platforms

We want this parser to be widely supported on common platforms:

* Rust
* WASM
* Node.js
* Python
* Swift
* Kotlin
* C#

## Documentation

To be prepared.
